## Project Documentation
This is a two-semester senior-year capstone graduation project. In the first semester, we have produced the full documentation and description of the project. 
In particular, we prepared the Requirement Specification Document (RSD), System Design, UML Diagrams, and showed an interactive Prototype. 
The second semester was devoted for implementing all the functionalities that were specified in the first semester. 
To validate our work, a set of test cases were defined and generated to ensure that UHB community actually meets the client's needs.
